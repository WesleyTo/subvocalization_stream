# Subvocalization
- Files for the capture and processing of subvocal data as audio.
- This project is currently the combination of two iterations of the project
  - One of which used an external application (such as Audacity) to record the audio files as single large WAV files for post-processing
    - `check_audio.py`, `process_audio.py`, `upload_audio.py`, `flash_new.py`
  - The other uses a data stream from an Arduino to capture and split audio in real time
    - `main.ino`, `record_raw_data.py`

## Iteration 1

#### `flash_new.py`
- This script uses a pygame GUI to display words on the screen for the user to vocalize or subvocalize
- The script saves timestamps and words into a CSV file.
- It is also capable of logging keypresses for synchronizing with forearm EMG readings for a gesture-control dataset.
- The vocabulary is contained in the `configuration.json` file, but also has defaults to a basic set of control words.
- `python flash_new.py --csv /path/to/08_25_subvoc/outputs.csv`
- Run `python flash_new.py -h` for more usage help

#### `process_audio.py`
- This script takes in two arguments, the CSV generated by `flash_new.py`, and the dated directory to be processed
- Inside the audio directory should be a subdirectory called `original_audio` where the files are located
- The script will use the timestamps and labels from the CSV to split and organize the monolithic audio files into smaller ones.
- These split audio files will be put into a subdirectory called `split_audio`
- Running `python process_audio.py /path/to/08_25_subvoc` should result in this:

```
[08_25_subvoc]
|
L__ outputs.csv
L__ original_audio
|   |
|   L__ 01.wav
|   L__ 02.wav
|   ...
|
L__ split_audio
    |
    L__ LABEL_0
    |   |
    |   L__ ch1
    |   |   |
    |   |   L__ 000.wav
    |   |   L__ 001.wav
    |   |   ...
    |   |
    |   L__ ch2
    |   ...
    |
    L__ LABEL_1
    ...
```

#### `upload_audio.py`
- This script will upload the project files to a Google Storage Bucket, as determined by the `configuration.json` file
- Prefixes all the files with the same date as the parent directory
- `python upload_audio.py /path/to/08_25_subvoc`
- Stores the split audio as `08_25_audio.zip`
- Stores the original audio as `08_25_original_audio.zip`
- Stores the CSV file as `08_25_outputs.csv`

#### `check_audio.py`
- This script samples 10% of each label in a dataset and plays it back
- It allows the users to take note of mislabeled or otherwise corrupt samples
- `python check_audio.py /path/to/08_25_subvoc`

## Iteration 2

#### `main.ino`
- This arduino code uses timer interrupts to send a timed data stream
- At timed intervals, it will read from an analog source (such as a microphone or EMG electrode) on `A0`
- It sends the signal over `Serial` as a bytestream

#### `record_raw_data.py`
- This script takes reads in the bytestream from an Arduino and saves it as split audio (WAV) files
- Work in progress
- The script searches for an Arduino automatically, and will raise an exception if it cannot find one
- Once the Arduino is found, it will read the data into a buffer and save the buffered data into 1-second clips
- The clips are stored in a timestamped audio directory

## To-Do
- `record_raw_data.py`
  - The script currently has no customization options
  - It saves files wherever the script is run. The output directory should be user selectable
  - It truncates the buffer to 1 second of data and saves it. The length should be user selectable
- `main.ino`
  - The timing may be slightly off due to the imprecise nature of the Arduino crystal clock and prescalers used in the timer1 interrupt. Further research/experimentation is required
- `process_audio.py`
  - The script should have command line arguments for:
    - Sample Rate
    - Dry run
    - The number of threads to spawn
    - A post-processing configuration file, `postprocess.json`, that can store operations to run on the dataset
  - The script should be able to read in and parse a post-processing configuration file so the user can define directory-specific post-processing requirements
- `check_audio.py`
  - The script should generate an output file that stores the names of the files marked as incorrect or corrupt
- `upload_audio.py`
  - The script should also upload the yet-to-be-implemented `postprocess.json` as `08_25_postprocess.json`
